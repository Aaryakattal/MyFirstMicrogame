# MyFirstMicrogame

Project Title: "My First Microgame(FPS)" 

Description: For my first person shooter game I added 3 custom features, 1: I added another higher platform to place rooms, enemies and pickup items (Unitypic1). 2: An enviorment change adiing mushrooms and trees to protect the player for the larger amount of enimies around the map (Unitypic2). 3: More enimeies for the player to fight and strategize against (Unitypic3). 4: A pickup shotgun for the player to use to defeat the enimeis (Unitypic4).

Setup Instructions: To start my game I open unity and click on the project file "My first microgame" then it opens the game and runs it on Unity 6. Then press play and play the game. To maximize click the 3 dots at the top of the game and when the tab opens under it click maximize.

Reflection: As I made my first microgame, I learned how to change the color of the floor, raise the jump height of the character, and create custom features using prefabs. All of these were covered in the tutorials, which helped me along the way, but I was really impressed with myself when I figured out how to add extra enemies, a pickup object like a shotgun, and obstacles for the enemiesâ€”such as palm trees for the player to take cover behind. The majority of my changes were either environmental or mechanical. An example would be a mechanical addition like the pickup shotgun, while an environmental change would be to expand the map and add elements like mushrooms, rocks, and palm trees.
